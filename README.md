# Verilog Codes

### Steps to edit and run the code with Icarus Verilog

Step-1: Write a verilog code

```
$ gedit hello1.v
```

Step-2: Compiling a verilog code with icarus verilog

```
$ iverilog hello1.v
```

Step-3: run the code

```
$ vvp a.out
```

In digital logic, an inverter or NOT gate is a logic gate which implements logical negation. 

3. basic gates

AND: Outputs HIGH when both inputs are HIGH.

OR: Outputs LOW when both inputs are LOW.

NAND: Outputs LOW when both inputs are HIGH.

NOR: Outputs HIGH when both inputs are LOW.

XOR: Outputs LOW when both the inputs are same.

XNOR: Outputs HIGH when both inputs are same.
