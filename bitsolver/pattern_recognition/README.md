# Pattern Recognition

The design is used to can detect `0110` and increments the `counter` when it detects the pattern. The problem statement is from [bitsolver.io](https://bitsolver.io/problem/3). 

**I/O Ports:** 

Name		| Type	| Size
--- 		| --- 	| ---
clk 		| input	| 1
srst_n	| input	| 1
din			| input	| 1
counter	| output| 16

**Test pattern:** 

```
1 0 0 1 1 1 1 0 1 0 1 1 0 0 1 0 1 0 1 
```
